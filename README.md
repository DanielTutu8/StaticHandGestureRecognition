# StaticHandGestureRecognition
Hand gesture recognition with python


This a software that recognize just a few gestures like: zero, one, two, three, four, five, ok, fist

The gesture must be seen in the square on the screen in order to be recognized

The camera must be connected if you use a dedicated camera, if you have an integraded one, even better

Cheers!
